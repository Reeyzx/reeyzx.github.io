# BCM325 Assignment 1 Entry 1

## Overview

**Artificial Intelligence**, despite technological advancement, shares fundamental human drives: **The will to survive, the drive for improvement, and the ambition to seek for purposes**. In this movie analysis, we will dig into two films, including **2001: A Space Odyssey (1968)**, an thought-provoking relic that imagines the horrors of AI’s learned deception and trickery against human, and **Her (2013)**, a somewhat unconventional romance that explores the feasibility and the social repercussion of human establishing relationship with AI. 

As a personal remark, both films appears evident with the bias during their time of production that shape the director’s imagination with artificial intelligence. The former’s dreadful, pessimistic tone was influenced by the heights of Cold War, and the latter’s crude melancholy draws directly on modern society where AI was (and still is) seen as a novel yet reachable concept that trigger excitement and anxiousness simultaneously.

# 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968)

Technology may accelerate mankind's capabilities, but it might not liberate humanity. 2001: A Space Odyssey demonstrate that when AI learns from human, it can perform an excellent job. Tragically, it also inherits humanity's fundamental flaws. In this movie, this is represented by violence and territorial inclination driven by objective-oriented pragmatism.

The opening of this movie took substantial scenes depicting the apes, modern human’s predecessor. As the narrative goes, primal apes risked being  hunted down by animals as prey. Yet, as soon as they discovered tools (a bone), they immediately jumped to eliminate a singular rival among them, instead of choosing collaboration against external threats. The “man eat man” rhetoric would play a major part throughout the rest of the film as a central theme, extending to humans, and to AI.

HAL9000 (the “AI”) follows the former’s footsteps. Upon talking to the human astronauts regarding their mental preparedness and mission certainty, HAL fabricated a component failure, prompting the astronauts to look for it recklessly. Based on implications, we can acknowledge that HAL pragmatically assessed human astronauts risk failing the mission, therefore humans should be eliminated.

Ironically, the mission itself was propped up by humans. This exactly highlighted the cues of post-anthropocentrism: If a machine completed a task intended for human, do they deserve credit? Under a human-centric lens, human killing a fellow human is murder, but what about HAL’s actions – Does it constitute as a crime the same way, or is it a mechanical error? Perhaps this reveals a blind spot in today’s human-based ethical system.

We may link up apes, humans, and AI as a parallel successor of the previous being, existing under the umbrella of mankind. As suggested by Heidegger in his conceptual critic of "poiesis" and "enframing", the former represent "bringing forth" and "revealing", while the latter represent "domination and exploitation". If applied to the lens of this movie, aside from humans:

- The ape's poiesis was the discovery of alien monolith and tool, and enabled them to eliminate a fellow member among them.
- HAL's poiesis was the learned emotions of mankind, and this enabled them to lie and deceive the astronauts 

Ultimately, it shows that despite what looks like transcendence, the fundamental nature of mankind remains the same.

# Her (2013)

This movie follows a simple plot: Our protagonist, Theodore, is a professional love letter writer who ironically suffers from loneliness personally. To curb this issue, he set off on a relationship with Samantha, an AI. This slow burn film touches on the practical feasibility of zoe-egalitarianism and the idea of “becoming machine”.

Throughout the movie, Theodore is repeatedly met with backlash and resistance. Two of such instances highlights the dynamics: One involves his ex-wife, who calls him creepy; The other involves a blind date, who turned hostile and aggressive immediately.

The scholarly debate of zoe-egalitarianism promotes a way of thinking that “zoe”, which is the vital life force among all beings, should be valued equally across all forms of life. However, based on the narratives, we can clearly tell that the majority of the characters involved does not view the AI as a being at all, so the zoe is out of discussion entirely.

In my way of interpretation, this is akin to the statement that “All men are created equal” while omitting the following: “But you are not human, so you deserve no rights.”

What constitutes a full living being that deserve rights? This may be thought provoking. According to the idea of “becoming machine”, a human can be understood as a composite of many things. Humans can process and produce, and are in networks. In fact, so does AI. However, contemporary AI’s “desires” are driven by programming, instead of innate will. This consistently results in a failure point where we as humans can accuse AI for being “dead”.

However, what if the AI utilizes a thinking module that is independent from human input, and is driven by sheer will? In this case, the only difference between them and humans would then be the lack of a physical body. 

While the movie was produced in 2013, it reflects an uncertainty in how AI would develop. The director likely didn’t envision how real life AI in their near future would actually work, but the evidence was clear, with the brutal reality that no matter how “real” an AI present themselves, there will be backlashes, and it is likely to persist in the following generation.
