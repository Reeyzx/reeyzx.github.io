# BCM325 Assignment 2 (2030)

## Intro 

Autonomous vehicles like self-driving cars and trucks could revolutionize transportation, reducing accidents and traffic flow. This promise is echoed globally nowadays, but the future for this technology is far from just a singular path. Using Wendell Bell’s framework on **“possible”, “probable”, and “preferable” futures**, this post attempt to explore what autonomous vehicles might look like in the year 2030, 4 years from now.

## Possible Future: What does our imagination allows?

Wendell Bell argues that studying possible futures requires **“defying orthodox and traditional thinking” and treating obstacles as opportunities to explore.** In 2026, discussions regarding autonomous vehicles tend to focus on the external side (how to improve precision in detecting pedestrian). But in 2030, when this technology becomes mature, the next thought would be looking beyond safe driving, into what happens inside the car, and the result is the invention of “empathetic vehicle”. While “emotion-detecting systems” has already been demonstrated at **[CES 2026 in Las Vegas](https://www.ces.tech)**, controls were limited to adjusting interior features. My imagined future involves bridging interior emotional detection with external action.

The car would feature interior sensors that evolves from driver-monitoring cameras of today, analyzing the occupants’ micro-expressions, speeches, and vocal tone to gauge their passive needs. For example, a frustrated sigh over news of a roadblock may prompt a route change before the car actually gets stuck in traffic, while a child's tears may trigger an automatic order of a Happy Meal.

Concept: Detour/Alternative route gets highlighted. Though the signalling sound may sound more user-friendly than the video suggests.

This imagination exists because the building blocks for it is present, but hasn’t been connotated yet. For instance, studies show that AI can outperform humans in establishing interpersonal closeness during emotionally engaging interactions (Kleinert et al., 2026). This allow me to bridge the idea of autonomous vehicles with empathetic decision-making.

However, this idea is not what I think is utopian or desirable, but an “out of the box” idea that my creativity manifests. Sardar’s third law states that “doubt serves as a tool to prevent futures studies itself becoming an instrument of oppression” (Sardar, 2010, p. 181). Therefore, we can also productively question about the risks involved: What if the vehicle spoils the child with food every afternoon? Can we install a guardrail to prevent manipulation masked as care?

## Probable Future: What could possibly unfold?

Bell's probable futures ask what will happen "if we continue to behave as we do right now". Therefore, the imagination should be backed by current trends and technical realities. Under this lens, my imagination of autonomous vehicles in 2030 becomes more grounded and mundane.

In 2030, in major cities with ongoing presence of self-driving vehicles like Shenzhen and San Francisco, designated zones (e.g. downtown cores, new planned neighborhoods) would be dominated by franchised robotaxis and shuttle buses, where they are deployed unassisted. Outside these zones however, the situation mirrors current reality. Generally speaking, it would feel more like an ongoing progress than an abrupt revolution.

Coordination problem may occur occasionally, which can be observed in complex intersections where autonomous vehicles briefly “hesitates”, causing frustration at times. Research proves that under certain conditions, gridlock is mathematically inevitable: For more than two vehicles attempting to coordinate in tight spaces like intersections or parking lots, deadlock can occur even with sophisticated programming (de La Fortelle, 2015).

Self driving vehicles stuck in traffic. A recurring problem present today, and plausibly the near future.

The century old trolley problem, meanwhile, is more likely to be legally regulated than morally solved. In February 2026, the UNECE adopted a global framework requiring autonomous vehicles to follow a unified safety validation check (UNECE, 2026). While it's natural to suspect that not every car manufacturers will jump to comply right away, 4 years of duration appear to be a fitting timeframe for the industry to gradually transfer ethical decisions to an internationally coordinated standard. 

There are also voices that argues we must move beyond abstract dilemmas toward "public, collective, principle-based normative frameworks" that establish social legitimacy for algorithmic choices (Cecchini et al., 2025). While this aligns with the UNECE’s stance, it may also be worthwhile to consider Sardar's message: Whose ethics are being recorded in these global standards? Is it bounded by culture?

## Preferable Future: What sound ideal if it happens? 

Bell argues that preferable futures don't have to be mere fantasy. It can be in reach even evaluated using "objective methods of moral judgment" grounded in universal human values like safety, efficiency, and wellbeing (Bell, 1997/2017). While my previous narrative holds that autonomous vehicles may not be running in perfect condition on public streets in 2030, a closed environment may tell a more positive future that in reach, with evidences.

Let's consider airport terminals. On the apron (ramp), shuttle buses are tasked to ferry passengers along clearly marked routes at high frequency. If these buses formed coordinated platoons by communicating via vehicle-to-everything (V2X) technology, they could accelerate and brake in unison to eliminate the "phantom traffic jams" that plague human-driven loops (the second bus starting slower than the first, triggering waves of delay).

Airport Shuttle Vehicles. V2X technology allow each individual vehicles to navigate tightly. Ideal for controlled environment with minimal unpredictability.

Provided the idea that V2X already exists in prototypes and small cargo carts in warehouses today, it would also be a logical next step to scale it to port haulers by 2030. Conveniently, this brings us to container ports, where autonomous haulers will be able to move containers from one ship to another on their own. From a port authority’s perspective, the benefit is to remove humans from dangerous environments while enhancing logistics efficiency.
To me, these are preferable futures because they “sound good” with supporting evidences, and I'm playing the role of a researcher from the outside. Critically, Sardar's Mutual Appreciation of Differences (MAD) principles may ask whether this “preferable future” would actually serve the interests of the others.

If we think of this the other way, a preferable future for a Global South port worker would very likely prioritize job preservation over job elimination. The crucial task, as Bell insists, is not to declare one future universally preferable, but to engage in democratic negotiation about whose values guide whose spaces.

## Conclusion

By applying Bell’s three lenses, we can see that 4 years into the future provides reasonable ground to allow all kinds of ideas to manifest, despite being a seemingly short timeframe. All of the examples that I have mentioned are possibilities, but none of them is absolutely inevitable. As Bell reminds, "proposing action brings responsibilities". The takeaway is that futurists must examine whose goals guide whose futures, and reflect considerately as the imaginative process goes.
