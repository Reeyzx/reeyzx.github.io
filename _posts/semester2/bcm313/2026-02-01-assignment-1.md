Disruption and changes are two things that pains all of us in an unpredictable manner. It is our nemesis. One might view it as separated ideas, but I believe it's an intertwined concept. 

What constitutes "disruption and changes"? For me, it means that you were originally doing something and expect it to always be like that. Until it isn't and catches you off guard. This is the disruption. When you get over with the 5 stages of grief due to said disruption, and begin doing things under the new normal, that is the changes.

To me, one of such incident comes off as particularly impactful to my personal development.

# The story

For more than 5 years, I have been a part of a friend group who produce games on Roblox. Among us, one who joined later was a guy our age, who I perceived to fall short on technical mastery, but compensated by his sheer ambition. In this story, I'll refer to him as "A". A and I have worked in many projects in the past, and most collaborations usually unfold in a similar manner as what happened here. It is not a unique story, but it is definitely the last of such a story.

It was a Sunday afternoon, when we were building a prototype for a cafe job simulation game. we got to our computers, and we cut to the task immediately. 

There weren't a lot of discussions involved. A spent the next several hours assembling the early prototype, as I documented what features can be implemented. That evening, I returned to check up on the progress, and the result wasn't quite polished.

"Well, it's not good. Not good means bad. Bad means I have to make it good!"

I began editing his work. From my perspective, the result is now polished -- Prettier, fancier, and the concept stays identical. For reasons I cannot grasp at that time, he began withdrawing from our group since then, and eventually went into hiatus. That was the disruption. It was quick, it was swift, and concerningly silent. 

It goes without saying that the rest of us were gutted. We attempted to reach him to check up on his wellbeing, but to no avail. Eventually, time causes us to put him not to the backseat, but inside the trunk. Our group carried on. Until 2 years later, he crawled out and left us a message that he's currently doing well as a solo developer before disappearing again. After a moment of reflection, I did not respond to his response. And so, the story ended in a somewhat anti-climatic manner.

# Personality

There was a major degree in how my personality traits enabled the disruption in the first place, under the [Myers–Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI)](https://www.myersbriggs.org) framework, I am an [ISTP](https://www.16personalities.com/istp-personality), which means:

- I am introverted (I). 
- Sensing (S) as my active tool. This means I engage by focusing on practical, real-time facts and what’s happening in front of me. 
- My Thinking (T) works in the background as an inner logic system, analyzing how things work in a detached but efficient way. 
- Perceiving (P) at the end means that Sensing (S) is my active, outward-facing tool. In contrary, it would be Thinking for an ISTJ.

As a result, I tend to be adaptable, hands-on, and focused on responding to immediate situations. I trust reality over plans and keep options open by fixing problems as they arise. 

What problem arises in this specific story? I believe the answer is that I tend to think on the spot and do as I go, resulting in a critical lack of communication between my teammates like A, and I. Because I failed to convey my vision in a concise manner, he interpreted his tasks in his own vision, which causes a mismatch when the work is finally delivered. Subsequently, due to my tendencies to react to hands on issues, I “polished” his work to make it go according to my original plan, leading to A’s disappointment.

# Social Roles

When I polished A’s work, I stepped into the project assuming there was a shared meaning existing between us. In my perspective, adding new things on top of his work is an act of constructive development where we work together to yield an improved outcome. However, I neglected one critical problem that A was a late-comer, and I was one of the founders of the group. Given this role hierarchy, A likely saw it as a violation of his personal vision because I robbed him of his creative freedom, but assumed it as futile to protest verbally. Based on ideas of social construction, interaction is required to foster a meaning. From this way of thinking, perhaps A’s withdrawal was a way to signal his dissatisfaction symbolically.

## Game Theory

A’s silent departure can be further explained via a twisted version of the prisoner’s dilemma. 

![Game Theory Spreadsheet](/assets/images/bcm313_assets/assignment_1/diremma_payoff_en.png)

In a normal game, collaboration yields the most coins, which is originally the rational choice in the context of a functioning team. However, my editing unintentionally rewired the payoff structure of choosing collaboration by lowering coins earned for collaborate and increasing that for defect. Which made collaboration unattractive to him, under the belief that my edit violates his vision and a loss of status. That makes choosing defect (withdrawal) the more beneficial choice, where he get to preserve personal dignity as a solo developer, which revealed a fundamental mistake on my behalf.

Yet, the game theory reveals an optimal principle to be forgiving but retaliatory. My silence to his 2-year late response is logically rational under the strategy of “tit for tat” in prisoner’s dilemma, where I do exactly as the other player does in the previous round, as a pragmatic exchange. However, I choose not to blame him for his personal decision, as he had the rights to quit.

Perhaps the true disruption didn't start from A's silence, but when I (or the others) approach things with insufficient communication. While it's not possible to reverse the changes, we can always study from it as hard lessons.
