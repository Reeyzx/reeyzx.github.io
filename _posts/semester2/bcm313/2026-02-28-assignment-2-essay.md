**Reflective Essay Portion**

# Opening

The idea of "future of work" is often framed with ideas like **technological disruption, automation, and the need for new skills.** While these were all major trends, they can also be felt personally. Workers may have to keep reconstructing their professional identities in response to ever-changing demands in the same occupation. 
    
Social constructionism, the central topic covered in our Week 3 lecture, proposes that the meanings we hold about ourselves and our work are not discovered internally, but is in fact a product built through ongoing interactions with others (Berger & Luckmann, 1966). Using this framework as inspiration, I will analyze the three moments included in my narrative CV to show how my professional values (authenticity, quality, and perseverance) were socially constructed through each individual encounters.

# Incident #1

## Situation
My first encounter with **authenticity** came from a Roblox game titled "This is no Simulator". At 14, I clicked into the game to expect casual entertainment, but I ended up discovering a morally heavy manifesto. The game's content covered the owner's personal critique of the mindset of Roblox developers at that time, prioritizing microtransactions over genuine experience. 

## Analysis
If we analyze from the social constructionist lens, my sense of authenticity wasn't an innate belief. It was externalized by the creator through his game, and I subsequently took it as a personal principle. While it felt like my own discovery, it was actually a social transaction. 

In the future of work, where AI generated content and embedded algorithms increasingly shape what we can see, and what we cannot see, the ability to question "what's really driving this?" becomes a matter of critical literacy. To support this idea, the Week 3 material also emphasizes that responsibility for learning now falls on workers themselves (BCM 313, 2026). Therefore, my Roblox encounter can be considered as an early, informal lesson regarding the responsibility to choose whose voices get to shape my standards.

## Incident #2

## Situation
The second story concerns a sharper, perhaps more toxic lesson in self-assessment. Years later, I joined a small Roblox game design group. In the group, I was producing up to three soapbox car models daily. While my tiny team was enthusiastically supportive, I mistook their encouragement as a concrete proof that my work was good. Without knowing any social cues, I uploaded about 25 vehicle models into a larger Discord server's "Creations" channel, and faced a brief public mockery.

## Analysis
Via social constructionism, we can grasp the idea that my peers had built a supportive space where quantity felt like quality. However, the Discord community *deconstructed* that reality through brutal feedback, forcing me to *reconstruct* my internal standards (Berger & Luckmann, 1966). 

This revealed that my later will to pursue quality was not possessed all along. The quality mindset only manifested after I dealt with a conflict. The Week 3 material emphasizes that remote and dispersed work reduces opportunities for informal learning through observation (BCM 313, 2026). Taking the roasting incident as a reference, when there is an absence of organic feedback, workers must intentionally seek critique. This is a directly transferable skill to individuals in pre-assigned teams where performance feedback is rarely given spontaneously.

## Incident #3

## Situation
My third story moves from external feedback to internal resilience, which took place during a three-day game jam. Collaborating with my own friends, everything went smoothly until two hours before submission, when our game's ending cutscene failed to load. We scrambled for a bug fix but ultimately didn't win. As a consolation prize, we received a €2 Steam card that some of us perceived to be as a humiliation.

## Analysis
Social constructionism helps explain both the initial humiliation. The game jam assigned us an achieved status (playing as competitors), with the potential to become "winner". When we lost, the €2 gift card, despite containing monetary value, functioned as a symbolic marker of our comparatively low placement. What ended up "stinging" was what the gift card communicated about our rank, instead of the fundamental value behind the card itself.

As Goffman's dramaturgy suggests, we were performing the role of a group of "serious developers" on a public stage with real audiences, and the consolation prize felt like a failed performance (Goffman, 1959). Subsequently, some among us found this more insulting than the others, which Cooley explained that we each imagined how others perceived us, and we internalized that imagined judgement differently (Cooley, 1902, cited in BCM 313, 2026).

Yet, skills that we learned on the spot during the abrupt bug fixing process eventually proved itself useful in new projects. Again, our group collectively *reconstructed* the meaning of the experience from a humiliating loss to a learned experience. This act mirrors the observation that workers must find ways to learn and adapt with less organizational support (BCM 313, 2026). 

# Conclusion

As work becomes more dispersed, automated, and project-based, the responsibility for constructing meaning, as well as maintaining standards, is increasingly becoming the matter for the individuals to bear. This imply that workers can no longer solely expect organizations to give them all the feedback or structured learning. While the specific roles and situations involved in my experience (e.g. game jam, mainstream game developers) reflect only a specific industry, the general idea suggests that to navigate this new work landscape, the capability to be mindful enough to study how our realities get constructed, may just be as important as technical fluency.
