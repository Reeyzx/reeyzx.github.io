The concept of "future of work" is undeniably an everchanging concept in today's society. Many, especially the so-called industry experts, claim that they possess insider information regarding the latest trends on the glocal workforce. 

To study their insights, I have selected an article from December 2025, titled "What are the top workplace trends in 2026?" The article was published by Hays, which is a multinational recruitment services agency.

# How does Hays talk about the future of work?

Interestingly (perhaps ironically), the article's tag features both "employers" and "job seekers", but the actual content is heavily geared towards the former. This is identifiable via key words throughout the article, like "your organization" and "your workforce strategy", assuming the audience's role as a leader or manager in the industry. Nevertheless, I believe the exclusion of job seekers are understandable, given Hays' nature as a recruitment agency, which is likely primarily subscribed by employers.

The article covered an extensive range of topics. To condense its length, I will use a direct excerpt summarizing Hay's vision regarding the future of work:

1. AI-enabled talent takes centre stage.
2. Early careers will be redefined amid automation-induced concerns.
3. Organisations must tackle the latest mutation of ‘Technostress’: FOBO.
4. Life Sciences will lead global industry growth.
5. Trust must be re-established in the AI era. 

Evidently, this article primarily revolves around the impact of AI. According to the writer, Generative AI removes many "first rung" tasks, resulting in a decline of entry-level jobs. Which, as they believe, would pose a disruption to the younger generation who freshly enters the workforce, seeking fundamental tier jobs to start their career with. 

I believe their way of framing the emergence of AI is also worth noting. They perceive automation as an inevitable disruption requiring adaptation, instead of something to be resisted or to fight against directly. This can be interpreted as a silent acceptance from their perspective.

In terms of how the article is structured and presented, the writer referenced a large amount of data from multiple sources from the US, the UK, Germany, and other platforms to back their stance. However, all 3 expert's voices mentioned in the article originate from Hays themselves, and their way of choosing their word can be described as very militaristic-like. Below are some examples that I noticed:

- Taking centre stage
- Explosive growth
- Perfect storm
- Strategic challenge
​

There is also a heavy sense of urgency from their end, using very absolute terms like:

- 2026 must be
- Risk falling behind
- Move first

# What is Hays' story of the future of work?
   
Overall speaking, Hays appears to have a firm, black-and-white stance regarding what is "good work", and what is non-viable work. Their story's reasoning is heavily correlated with the emergence of AI in the job market. Here is how we can interpret it in a three-tiered system

1. "AI-Adjacent" roles, which means jobs that bridge the gap between AI output and human business impact takes the top spot as the most valuable job. Among which includes jobs like ethics specialists who helps install moral reasoning, UX designers who design user-friendly interfaces to use AI, or prompt engineers who directly instruct AI workflows.
2. "High value strategic work". In which, Hays heavily emphasized the Life Sciences sector.
3. "Upskilled workers". It is particularly intriguing to note that this is not specific jobs, but instead referring to workers who demonstrate "mental elasticity and hunger to learn", and possessing "AI fluency" and "AI wisdom"

Inversely, it is emphasized that "entry-level" jobs like data entry workers and programmers are going to be devalued. The article also cited jobs like marketing, engineering, and people/HR workers. All of which are very broad jobs with slowly declining functions.

## If so, who will be doing this work?

Hays gave a very straightforward answer -- Nobody. Except for personnel who reviews AI output. The writer's justification was that AI is ultimately a tool, and a tool requires a human to use it and keep it in check. There is a small degree of irony in here: If you need a person to sit behind the desk and monitor a functioning AI, does it differ much from data entry workers? Perhaps this may be a question worthy of a second thought.

Judging by this article's narratives, the main audience is very evidently decision-makers who hire, fire, upskill, or offshore, aligning with what was brought up early on. The article ignored the vast majority who does not run a corporation or wields no decision-making power for the industry. In addition, I did not notice any paragraphs that address jobs outside of AI's sphere of influence. What may be the future of an aging worker? What about a professional who also does caregiving? For these individuals (which could possibly be a majority), they may understand the trajectory of the future of work, but unlikely to find a takeaway advice from there.

# My Application

## Am I being excluded?

Well, I certainly believe so. 
    
As an audience, the article explicitly mentioned "your organization" and "your workforce strategy", which means anyone that is not a current corporate leader is not their target reader. 
    
Geographically speaking, although the article came from "www.hays.com.hk", Hong Kong isn't mentioned once in their growth projections. On the other hand, Denmark, Sweden, Malaysia, Spain, and Belgium was mentioned for Life Sciences, while Canada and India was cited as "emerging hubs". While I believe this is not necessarity a dismissal of other countries' potential, there is no takeaway in my current position.
​
As a freelance game developer, my situation doesn't fit in any of their established categories mentioned in the article. However, if I were to extract the nature of my work (e.g. AI-fluent, creative-strategic) and apply said terms in Hays' framework, I would appear "advantageous" on paper, but it must be acknowledged that indie creative work simply doesn't exist in their evaluation.
    
## How does my personality type deal with these situations

As an ISTP, I understand Hays' positioning as a recruitment agency helping employers find employees, instead of a service helping workers find suitable jobs. I believe this context matters a lot when evaluating their claims, which I prefer to test against reality rather than accept on authority. 

The article's definitive rhetoric ("2026 must be," "risk falling behind," "move first,") as mentioned early on, suggests a secondary intention of installing fear to push audiences toward Hays' services, generating revenue for them. This come to be sensible when we factor in a harsh reality that the agency's fundamental purpose is similar to that of the HR department, which was ironically cited as a sector in decline. This may also explain why published sources on the future of work shift dramatically every few years. It potentially reflects a reality that they can't actually predict the trajectory many years into the future, but they can publish predictions anyway to serve a pragmatic business benefit. 

However, it would be irrational to dismiss this article's commentary on the future of work in a short-term scale. Hays made a valid point framing AI disruption as inevitable and emphasizing "mental elasticity", which are traits that may be advantageous given my personality, hence I should learn how to gain with this piece of information. Yet, the "trajectory" they present today could easily become obsolete several years later, favoring entirely different skillsets. So to conclude, it may be wisest for me to further enrich my capability to adapt to different nature, and to consistently be up-to-date with the true realities of work that changes every now and then.
