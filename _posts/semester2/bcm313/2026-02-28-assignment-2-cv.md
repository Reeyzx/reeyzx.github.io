# BCM 313 Assignment 2

# “This is no Simulator”
**Authenticity: The path to ask the meaning and motivation**

The story started when I was about 14. Surely 2019 wasn’t a distant past, but entertainment was simpler back then. Less unpredictability, and no brainrots.

I had no particular interests aside from engaging in evening Roblox gaming sessions. I would click into anything I could see on the front page and sink hours upon hours of time in it, regardless whether it's genuinely thoughtful or just an engagement trap.

One day, I came across a title called “This is no Simulator.”

“It’s a simulator ey, why not?” And so I clicked. 

In a straightforward way, the “simulator” was in fact a manifesto fest that warned players how Roblox was becoming soulless because of the game developers' predatory money-making tactic. It's safe to say the creator behind this “no simulator” was gutted and disheartened by what he witnessed.
Cliche? Absolutely. However teenage me thought it's deep and took it to heart. 

## Value in practice:

From that day, I began recognizing authenticity as my principle. Even until years later, I would still recall that manifesto when I see a Roblox developer pushing microtransactions, or when a Youtuber start chasing trends. The experience taught me to ask what the real motivation is: Be it working on my own project, or consuming another creator’s content.

# Building Cars
**Quality: The fall from Mt. Stupid to Valley of Despair**

I picked up an interest in game designing. 

On a random Tuesday, I saw a fellow Discord server member advertising his Roblox “soapbox cars racing” group. I later went up to him and signed up for the design “department”, which consisted only about 3 people. Nevertheless, sheer enthusiasm fueled their supportiveness, and I had a great time in that community assembling things inside the program.

Soon enough, I find myself churning up new designs like a factory, producing up to 3 soapbox cars per day. Because everyone in the group supported me, I expected people outside would do so as well, so I selected about 25 finished models and confidently dumped it into a big Discord server’s “Creations” channel.

And then I got roasted. Hard. That was when I stopped posting altogether to reflect on the concept of quality over quantity.

## Value in practice:

Before I send anything out to an audience, I imagine myself as a stranger and view my work from a third person perspective. Would it survive? If not, there should be room for improvement.

# The Game Jam
**Perseverance: Will to Keep Going**

A few years later, I found myself working with several like-minded friends, and we formed a group (studio) together, where our motto is to "strive for excellence". With encouragement from several of our group’s fans, we signed up for a 3-day game jam, competing against other participants to build a game under a common theme. The winner will be voted.

Everything went smoothly until approximately 2 hours before the submission deadline:
“Finally, the protagonist will arrive at the rooftop, and a cutscene should trigger. Wait, where's the cutscene?”

“I'm trying to port in the animations! Why is the character doing a T-pose when I try to import it from Blender into our cutscene? Call everyone quickly, let's gather the others and solve this.”
Long story short, we got to the third runner up spot in the game jam. The consolation prize was a €2 Steam Gift Card.

We didn't win, and the consolation prize likely felt more like a humiliation than a congratulation. However, after walking out of the development crunch, I realized the game jam wasn't a wasted effort as we did team up to try to tackle an obstacle despite little hope of winning. We walked out of the game jam learning something new, and the same knowledge was eventually applied to our later projects.

## Value in Practice:

I used to think perseverance mean pushing through to win. I then realized even when winning is off the table, it's still worth it to pursue, because the process to learn happens either way.

# The Takeaway & Where This Is Going

Looking back, I notice an interesting pattern I didn't see while experiencing firsthand.
At start, I learned from the manifesto to ask “why”. It set myself a fundamental principle to look past the surface and question what's powering things from behind the scene. When I set off and experienced the roasting, the “why” went from facing outward to facing inward, allowing me to judge myself pragmatically. Lastly, the game jam served as an additional reminder that even when reality present itself as unfavorable, there's could still be value in continuing anyway and give it a final push.

Summarizing things up, my core value would be **authenticity, quality, and perseverance.** I see myself as someone who wants to create things and be mindfully awake while in the process. Considering the mainstream voices of uncertainty regarding the future of work amidst the rollout of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and automation, I believe it would be especially crucial to be a person of agency who make choices on my principles instead of hopping between hype trains.
