# 2001: A Space Odyssey

Review




early on in the movie, the apes went from being mauled by animals as prey to discovering tools (a aingular bone). However, instead of collaborating, the film deliberately depict them engaging in group bullying behavior where multiple apes beat up a single person among them.

Later on, inside the space station, the protagonist engaged in a discussion regarding an unknown virus outbreak with the foreign scientist, but withheld information due to "not possessing the authority to do so"

I interpret this as a deliberate parallel. The movie shows that technology accelerate mankind's capabilities, but it does not liberate humanity. Instead, it reflects the fundamental flaw of human, which carries the essence of violence and territorial inclination, as suggested by Heidegger in his conceptual critic of "poiesis" and "enframing".
