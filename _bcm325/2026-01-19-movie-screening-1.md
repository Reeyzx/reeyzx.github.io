# 2001: A Space Odyssey

Review




early on in the movie, the apes went from being mauled by animals as prey to discovering tools (a bone). However, instead of collaborating, they almost immediately engaged in territorial behavior where multiple apes eliminate a singular rival among them.

The plot then advances into humanity. Inside the space station, when the Russian scientist inquire the American astronaut regarding a mysterious virus, the astronaut withheld information due to "not possessing the authority to do so", rather hide than to be truthful. Suggesting the concept of nation triumphs over humanity.

The final acts involving HAL9000 follows the apes and human's footsteps. Upon talking to the astronaut regarding mentality, HAL immediately fabricated a component failure, claiming AE-35 would fail within 72 hours, prompting the astronauts to look for it. If we think of it from a twisted way, it's possible that HAL wanted to test human's trust and compliance, and at worst, begin attempting to eliminate the humans to achieve the goal of mission success. 

We may link up apes, humans, and HAL (machine intelligence) as a parallel successor of the previous being, existing under the umbrella of mankind.

The movie shows that technology accelerate mankind's capabilities, but it does not liberate humanity. Instead, it reflects the fundamental flaw of human, which carries the essence of violence and territorial inclination. 

As suggested by Heidegger in his conceptual critic of "poiesis" and "enframing", the former represent "bringing forth" and "revealing", while the latter represent "domination and exploitation". If applied to the lens of this movie, aside from humans:

- The ape's poiesis was the discovery of alien monolith and tool, and enabled them to eliminate a fellow member among them

- HAL's poiesis was the learned emotions of mankind, and this enabled them to lie and deceive the astronauts 

Ultimately, it shows that despite what looks like transcendence, the fundamental nature of mankind remains the same
