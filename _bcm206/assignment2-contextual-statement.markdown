# BCM206 Contextual Statement

## Introduction

The Raycast Vehicle Chassis Project is intended to be an open-sourced experimental platform for aspiring Roblox game developers to study advanced vehicle mechanics through direct participation and playtesting. Readily available for trial play on Roblox , the project is entirely developed using AI assistance, functioning as a **demonstration for how modern networks redistribute a source of trusted knowledge in technical education.** Rather than consuming pre-packaged tutorials from singular expert sources, player-developers engage with a living, iterative project where their feedback directly shapes development.

This artefact **reflects the network society principles outlined in BCM206 Chapter 1,** demonstrating how decentralized knowledge creation and collaborative refinement can replace traditional hierarchical learning models. 

The project also **addresses an accessibility gap in Roblox physics education**, where most vehicle tutorials remain static and gatekept behind elite developer communities or closed-source implementations. This project challenges that model by enabling peer-to-peer learning about both vehicle physics implementation, and the emerging role of AI in creative production that requires a certain degree of technical expertise.

## Project Development Journey

Development occurred across 5 major versions between October and November 2025, each version responding to peer feedback and collaborative input. The rapid iteration demonstrates how network-enabled development compresses development cycles compared to traditional practices. Below entails what happened during the process:

### Version 7.x -- Minimal Viable Product (MVP)

Version 7.x established the MVP with basic "WASD" controls. Internal testing revealed a self-rotation bug, but rather than delaying release, the MVP prioritised accessibility. This decision reflects **a network-society principle of distributing incomplete work early to enable distributed testing,** rather than gatekeeping until perfection.

### Version 8.x -- First Design Iteration

Version 8.x marked the first design iteration following peer feedback. A classmate tested v7 and provided a critical observation:

- The system functioned 
- The chassis felt mechanically simplistic ("bareboned")

This feedback would catalyze the implementation of more advanced gearbox logic, horsepower mechanics, and transmission systems. Notably, the feedback wasn't expert instruction from an authority figure but subjective observation from a fellow peer who had no previous experience game developing, yet it sufficiently redirected development priorities.

### Version 9.x -- Bug Fixing

Version 9.x addressed technical debt from rapid feature expansion. The entire cycle dedicated to stabilization and bug fixing, revealing a structural problem requiring architectural redesign.

### Version 10.x -- Cross-institutional Knowledge Transfer

Version 10.x represented a critical moment illustrating cross-institutional knowledge transfer. A friend currently on his media internship semester in Europe mentioned **object-oriented design (OOD)** principles from his programming categories lecture. This knowledge, originating from a different institution, became integrated into this particular iteration through casual conversation. 

Rather than consulting professional tutorials, the decision was made to prompt AI to restructure the entire codebase following OOD principles. 

This version demonstrates how decentralization of information allows knowledge to freely transfer between institutional and geographic boundaries. A great leap from traditional gatekeeping structures.

### Version 11.x -- User Experience

Version 11.x shifted from code iteration to user experience, with environment design and demo space construction enabling public accessibility.

# Key Learning Moments

The discussion topic of my project is closely related to the categories topic of **network society.**

## **Learning Moment 1:** Decentralised Expertise vs. Hierarchical Authority

In the past, learning about game development meant relying on instructions from experts, most frequently through tutorials written by professionals, while newcomers simply followed along. Yet, today's networked society works differently. Key differences being that knowledge can be spread out, shared among many people, rather than having just one central authority in charge. This idea became obvious in my project during version 10, when a friend studying media mentioned object-oriented design (OOD) from his categories. Just chatting about it was enough for me to completely change how the project's structure worked.

There was no formal lesson or expert approval. An informal chat between peers can quickly evolve into major, concrete redesign. This shows how information can travel quickly and directly between people working together, even across countries, and still lead to real improvements. Instead of depending on official credentials or expert instruction, I found that peer suggestions and direct teamwork could be just as effective, and sometimes even better, as the advice fitted the actual situation. 

Another important lesson from this process was working with AI as part of the team. Instead of waiting for others to tell me what I could do, I questioned things out for myself, experimenting by giving it specific challenges. Each new version of the raycast vehicle taught me something about what AI could handle and where human guidance was needed. Rather than being shown how AI should be used, I learned by doing and sharing those results with my peers. In this way, collaborative learning, even involving AI, helped us all move forward more quickly and effectively.

## **Learning Moment 2:** Collaborative Refinement and Collective Intelligence

Perhaps Wikipedia is a great demonstration of how today’s network society works. Thousands of people contribute their ideas and corrections, rather than letting one single expert handle all the editing. My project reflected this exact approach, where participants has actual influence. From version 7 through 10, no-one involved fully understood everything about vehicle physics, code design, and user experience. Yet, small pieces of feedback from everyone helped finish the artefact through shared input, not a single guidebook.

Every contribution mattered, even from those who weren't experts in game mechanics or programming. I did not rely on one definitive tutorial, but drew on observations from my classmate, architectural hints from my international friend, and lots of hands-on testing. This mixture of input created a stronger result than if I'd followed just one expert. Getting things done in only four weeks, instead of months, showed how open collaboration and quick exchanges of ideas can speed up development and avoid the delays caused by waiting for formal approval.

As Chapter 1 explains, the ability to connect instantly with people, regardlessl of where they are, made all this possible. Advice and feedback from peers locally and globally, and even help from AI tools, blends together into one project. In the old model, centralized control would have slowed things down, but working in a network allowed for continuous, side-by-side teamwork that made the project much better, in much less time.​

# Development Context & Peer Engagement

## Peer Support and Collaborative Network

The classmate who identified functional limitations in v7 contributed partial expertise from gameplay experience, while the friend contributed OOD knowledge from his separate categories. These relationships were lateral peer participation instead of hierarchical mentorship. Each peer accessed the project directly and provided feedback, exemplifying Chapter 1's principle of "digital identities" individuals construct across platforms, where traditional role boundaries (e.g. a rigid "Audience", "Developer", "Critic") dissolve into blended, fluid collaboration.

The YouTube documentation in v11 extends peer support beyond the core development team by publicly sharing the playable experience, inviting broader community participation and feedback. By making the project publicly available, feedback from players and other developers naturally shapes how future updates and improvements are made. This open, ongoing exchange is key to how learning happens and how the vehicle system continues to develop.

## Conclusion

The Raycast Vehicle Chassis shows how learning and development can happen more openly and collaboratively. Instead of relying on static tutorials from one expert, developers and players help shape the project together by giving feedback, testing, and sharing ideas. We can learn that progress is driven by these everyday interactions, not just by top-down approval. Completing the chassis with realistic physics, a solid code structure, and making it open for everyone in limited timespan highlights how working together proves itself faster and more productive than traditional, expert-driven approaches under the context of today's online network. With new technology gradually phasing itself to the public, there is perhaps much more to anticipate for in the coming future.
