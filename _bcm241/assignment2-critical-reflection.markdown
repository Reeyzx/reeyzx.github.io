# Introduction to Media Niche 

In this follow-up reflection, I examine the auto-ethnographic process of creating and informing people of my experimental artifact across three platforms: Roblox, YouTube, and Bluesky. This project took root from my longstanding engagement with the Roblox developer community, where I transitioned from observing how programmers showcase sophisticated vehicle modules, to personally attempting to hands-on develop one of such creations myself. 

The three platforms represent distinct characters within the overall Roblox ecosystem: Roblox as the central site to host playable content, YouTube as the space for showcase and educate, and Bluesky as the news-sharing platform where players and developers alike receive niche feed. 

The focus of this auto-ethnographic account is to document and test the knowledge base of both Roblox players and developers (including myself) regarding raycast vehicle module production, as well as to uncover the underlying challenges of actual development that is not easily understood from the perspective of an observing party.

# Media Research Ethics Charter

Throughout the entire ethnographic research and artifect development process, I abide by the following ethical principles:

I treats all individuals and communities (developers, play testers, content creators, platform moderators) with dignity and consideration in every interaction and output, while avoiding actions that could disrupt community operations and follow staff guidance. When developing the product, I acknowledge accessibility needs of audiences from different geographical origins. For example, I included both KPH and MPH speed units in the simulated speedometer to cater to playtesters of different countries.

I Seeks explicit consent from others, and concisely inform that participation is optional and free from coercion. Anonymize names, avatars, and any identifiers unless permission is granted for attribution.

To ensure honesty, I properly states my research intentions, data collection methods, and how findings will be used to influence the artifact production. I also openly states my identity as a developer and academic researcher. 

All work involving the volunteering help of other creators & participants are credited.

# Platform Proliferation & Distribution 

From an outsider's perspective, it's easy to dream big and utopian. Everyone knows what makes a perfect vehicle chassis. For instance, subjective qualities like smooth, fun, and bug-free. But the issue was that, what "smooth" and "fun" mean to you might be completely different from what they mean to me. Do you want something that feels like Euro Truck Simulator's realistic physics, or something simple and arcade-y like Mario Kart? My research into the Roblox forums and community servers showed me how much my audience actually understands about vehicle mechanics, and more importantly, what they really want.​

The result eventually led me to settle on this approach: Mimic realism through an arcade-like input system that stays beginner-friendly. By reading what developers and players in this niche were vaguely describing, I figured out a latend demand that valued accessibility over pinpoint simulation accuracy.​

### Issue during development:

The biggest issue during development was achieving a **Minimal Viable Product (MVP)** within one week. People were waiting for results, and I had my own standards for what "done" should look like, but reality revealed the harsh truth that you can only accomplish so much within a specific timeframe. While this is an academic research project in a controlled environment, it mirrors how developers working on sophisticated projects in this (or similar) media niche face brutal judgements when expectations aren't met -- A reality that directly links to the next portion.

# Community Reception & Risk Management

### Making Something VS Making People Care:

With past experiences developing and releasing games on Roblox, I had confidence that at least *something* could be produced. Therefore, the task of producing a result itself wasn't particularly challenging, technically speaking. The real struggle was making hard work feel appreciated by people within this niche, which I believe consumed emotional labor and rational thinking to justify its worth.

### The Audience Problem:

To cover the task to post on 3 platforms, as well as facing audience involving both casual players and experienced developers, I essentially faces multiple different groups of people with their own agenda, despite covering the same media niche:​

Fellow developer peers may offer unsolicited help and code "improvements" that is well-intentioned but disregard my creative visions under time constraint. Due to their expertise, they excel at being mentors, but their intervention could compromise my pre-planned schedule and development pacing.

Random players unaware of this project's academic nature may interpret the raycast chassis through conventional game review frameworks. To them, bugs are flaws, incomplete features are failures. Without comprehending the hidden context, they may hold a genuine belief that the game is made half-heartedly.

### Paranoia:

The thing that perhaps concern me the most is review bombing, though there is currently no concrete evidence of such thing likely to take place, which hints at my own innate paranoia developed from previous experience as a developer. The Roblox community, like many gaming communities, can be harsh when personal expectations is not met from deliverables. My preparation measures involved careful framing across platforms by emphasizing academic context on the Roblox site descriptions, stating "DEMO" progress on Bluesky, as well as using YouTube's unlisted visibility to control disclosure.

With that being said, underlying tension remains unresolved: can developer's honesty and authenticity coexist with community reception "gatekeeping", or do these goals necessarily conflict against each other?

# Conclusion - From Audience to Creator

Being a creator in this community isn't primarily about technical mastery. Instead, it's more about navigating contradictory expectations, managing community relationships, and protecting creative work from unsolicited intervention. 

### Continuation on the DEMO:

I'm currently actively listening to emerging community feedback and advises, though further iterations will only be made following the end of the academic semester. By engaging with the media niche of Roblox raycast vehicle from observation to production process, I learned that authenticity in the creator role means embracing the vulnerability of unfinished work, while maintaining agency over when and how that work evolves. This exactly mirrors what I initially saw in the few demonstration videos on Youtube -- Audiences were split on how they felt, with many showing appreciation, but also some who revealed frustration and resentment.
