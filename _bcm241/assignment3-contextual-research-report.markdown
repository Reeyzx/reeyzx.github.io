# Introduction and Overview

Admittedly, my ethnographic investigation into the Roblox raycast vehicle development community didn't follow the assignment's intended structure. The original brief required selecting one video or post and engage with its specific audience, and then create content for that group based on their expressed needs. 

Instead, as documented in my Sharing Blog 1, I approached this as a broader study of developer community practices across multiple platforms, which included Youtube, Reddit, Discord, as well as Roblox DevForum. My Sharing Blog 2 shifted to content creation, building and distributing a raycast vehicle chassis on Roblox, and informed my audience via media platforms including YouTube and Bluesky.​

While my approach diverged from instructions, which I accept as a shortcoming, it gave me valuable ethnographic insights about the dynamics between creator and audience in technical communities, nevertheless. This report reflects critically on how moving from external observer to active creator revealed cultural patterns about the things that I discovered, most notably knowledge gatekeeping, "prestige" hierarchies, and audience expectations, which observation alone may be difficult to reveal, serving as conclusion to this ethnographic study.

# Persona Summary

My online persona differs across different platforms to manage community expectations and protect my creative work from premature judgment.

- On Roblox, I framed the project with explicit academic context in the demo experience description to signal that this was a part of research, instead of a ready-for-publish commercial project.
- On YouTube, I chose to set visibility to unlisted, to control disclosure timing. This is based on a pretense that public release might invite feedback I couldn't respond promptly, given deadlines on my academic side.​
- On Bluesky, I have included the term "DEMO" and hashtags (#roblox #robloxstudio #gamedev) to manage people's expectations about the project's currently experimental state.

This persona differed a lot from my everyday developer presence. Normally, I would share completed and polished work without explicitly framing it as a "research". My ethnographic persona required strategic gatekeeping, where I must be honest to my audience about limitations, without inviting harsh criticism. 

Wall (2006) emphasizes that autoethnography requires researchers to make themselves vulnerable while maintaining analytical distance. My persona balanced these demands, where I maintain transparency over the project's academic nature and incomplete status, while controlling when and how community members encountered my work.

# Key Epiphanies -- What Did I Uncover?

Throughout the entire ethnographic study process, I discovered 3 intriguing things that I previously didn't expect, or misunderstood in this niche community.

## #1: Creation is Social Labor, But Merely Technical Mastery

I learned that gatekeeping serves strategic purposes. Yet, too obvious gatekeeping creates a perceived displeasing aloof altitude, but complete transparency invites overwhelming criticism. In this community, it may be unwise to let others underestimate you, inversely, it may not be beneficial let the others overestimate you either. Honesty may be the top priority.

### My Encounter

Building the raycast chassis itself was technically manageable. Fortunately, I completed a functional Minimal Viable Product (aka MVP) in one week using AI-assisted programming (vibe coding). The unexpected challenge was navigating contradictory audience expectations after release:

- Fellow developers offered unsolicited code "improvements" that, while well-intentioned, disregarded my creative vision and time constraints.
- Players unaware of the project's academic context interpreted bugs as failures rather than research artifacts. Most significantly, I experienced occasional anxiety about review bombing despite no concrete evidence this would occur, paranoia reflecting my previous experiences in gaming communities where unmet expectations can risk triggering harsh community responses.​

The epiphany formed through these interactions: being a creator in this community isn't primarily about technical mastery. Secondary responsibilities also involve juggling contradictory expectations, managing community relationships, and protecting creativity and ambition from unsolicited intervention. Unfortunately, people can and will make your experience their own problem, expecting you to fix it. However, I must also acknowledge that this also works positively when they offer genuine assistance out of goodwill.

### Supporting Study

Wall (2006) argues that autoethnography requires researchers to place themselves in vulnerable positions where the community can affect them. My external observation phase (sharing blog 1) kept me safe from judgment, as I documented patterns without risking my own work to critique (I didn't have anything to present at that time). Only by releasing content and experiencing community response firsthand did I access a more thorough understanding of creator dynamics.​

Goffman's concept of front stage/back stage performance highlight this tension:
- Curated Bluesky updates, academic Roblox descriptions, technical discussions all projected competence and progress.(front stage)
- Managing paranoia, frustration with interventions, debates about compromising vision all remained hidden from audiences. (back stage)

Anderson (2006) emphasizes that complete member researcher status requires full participation in the community studied. By becoming a creator facing community judgment, I achieved insider access to emotional labor and social dynamics invisible from outside as just an observer.​

## #2: Gatekeeping as Self-Protection Against Prestige Threats

The act of gatekeeping itself isn't inherently malice. Interestingly, it may be used to serve self-protection effects in communities where technical reputation determines status (community's respect) and livelihood (profit & income). Understanding this fundamentally shifted my view from judgment to recognizing the fact how community pressures shapes how we approach knowledge-sharing.

### My Encounter

When I first watched **Dabidar's raycast vehicle demonstration video**, I interpreted the absence of tutorials as intentional superiority, assuming it's a powerplay involving experts showcasing work to impress rather than to teach. Most notably, comments on the video were split into three camps: simple praise-givers, people demanding tutorials who got ignored, and toxic gatekeepers claiming things such as "I built a tank before you did your car, it's nothing new." 

This pattern appeared across advanced developer showcases. There were sophisticated work being uploaded, but no accessible teaching resources provided that allow audience members to gain technical understanding from their work.

After completing my one-week demo vehicle using AI assistance, I might have understood why gatekeeping exists. What would take experienced programmers 2-3x longer, I accomplished rapidly through AI prompting at a pace previously unprecedented.

The realization was that I used to think experts gatekeep because they want to maintain technical superiority *("I'm perfect, why should I teach you?")*. Now, I figured they might be fearing they reveal their potential shortcomings *("It's not really as impressive as I want you to believe, but this is necessary to maintain my prestige because I genuinely can't afford overwhelming criticisms and competition")*.​

### Supporting Study

Burrell (2009) emphasizes that knowledge in digital communities circulates through networks, but not evenly across platforms. My investigation revealed a three-tiered hierarchy in Roblox development culture, based on my gains from this raycast vehicle study: 
- Elite developers engage in isolated circles (never reached them—only polished work visible on platform); 
- Experienced developers like Dabidar showcase but gatekeep;
- The vast majority knows little, struggling to strive for improvement from others.​

This structure protects reputation in an era where AI enables rapid skill compression. My project demonstrated that prestige may not be as prestigious as previously thought. The ones at the "top" of the hierarchy aren't untouchable. Yet, I remain aware of Dunning-Kruger effects: My project succeeded only due to careful AI utilization, not my personal programming mastery. I'm in no position to claim superiority over experienced programmers.​

## #3: Audience Needs Discovered via Observing Frustrations, Not Direct Inquiry

When I released the demo, responses confirmed this understanding. Feedback were highly concentrated on technical smoothness ("constant delay," "network ownership issues") and usability ("how do I drive this car?"), which was exactly the accessibility concerns I had identified early on. While no one has thanked me yet, the technical engagement demonstrates that the product addressed genuine community needs discovered via ethnographic observation of day-to-day frustrations instead of formal inquiry, like an interview.

### My Encounter

The assignment emphasized engaging with audiences and discovering their needs through conversation. I never conducted formal interviews or surveys. Instead, I listened to comparative judgments by the others, who expressed praises and frustrations in Discord discussions. Some of the examples included: 
- "Retail Tycoon 2 is fun to drift around and race, but you can't see the speedometer";
- "I don't even know how A-Chassis works. How do I even start the engine?".​

These comments revealed the latent demands that shaped the vision for my community-focused work. It turns out audiences wanted "arcade fun with realistic details", notably with accessibility over pinpoint simulation accuracy. This would inform my design decision to mimic realism through an arcade-like input system that stays beginner-friendly.​

### Supporting Study

Airoldi (2018) argues that digital ethnography must recognize how platform structures shape community interactions. Formal requests for audience input (e.g. "What do you need in a tutorial?") won't really yield genuine frustrations because people share complaints organically in casual conversation.

I observed and participated in naturally occurring conversations rather than creating artificial research situations, aligning with presented participant observation methodology. As stated in blog post 2 previously, players cannot articulate abstract needs but was capable of comparing concrete experiences. By listening to these comparisons, I discovered what vague terms like "beginner-friendly" mean to them.​

# Conclusion

These epiphanies above changed my understanding of the Roblox raycast vehicle community by revealing dynamics I could not access via observation alone. Below make up the summaries of what I learned:

- The knowledge vacuum epiphany challenged my assumption that communities function through open knowledge exchange by showing how expertise concentrates in private networks ("secret societies"), rather than public platforms (easily accessible).
- The creator vulnerability epiphany exposed emotional labor and social navigation as two easily overlooked core aspects of content creation. This extends further from my originally believed idea that technical mastery alone was suffice.
- The gatekeeping epiphany revealed self-protection motivations behind expert behavior, debunking surface theories over motive to maliciously hoarding valuable knowledge.​

Throughout this process, my ethnographic skills developed in ways aligning with BCM 241 course reading materials. I shifted from passive observation (blog 1's Reddit searches, forum browsing) towards active engagement (blog 2's content creation and community response management), demonstrating Wall's (2006) idea that autoethnography requires vulnerability. But most importantly, I've learned that ethnographic understanding requires humility. This is to accept and recognize when initial approaches fail, and utilize it as opportunities to extract insight, rather than defending flawed actions. 

My ethnographic investigation took place across 3 separated phases, from community observation, to product creation, and to community feedback. The 3 phases revealed different aspects of the community. This process helpedd me reinforce the idea that ethnographic research is iterative in nature, which prompts researchers to remain actively responsive at each stage of community engagement.
